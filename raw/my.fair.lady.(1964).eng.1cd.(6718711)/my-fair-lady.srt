that you're not a lady,

the police will take you
to the Tower of London

591
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,800
where your head will be cut off

592
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,900
as a warning
to other presumptuous flower girls.

593
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,400
But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present

594
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,400
of seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

you will be the most ungrateful,

and the angels will weep for you.

598

Now, are you satisfied, Pickering?

Oh, could l put it more plainly
or fairly, Mrs. Pearce?

Come with me, Eliza.

602
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,100
That's right, Mrs. Pearce.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

You're a great bully, you are.

What was l to think from that,
governor?

910
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,100
l ask you, as a parent,
what was l to think?

911
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,200
So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

912
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,900
Just so, governor, that's right.

913
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,200
Yes.

914
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,000
Mrs. Pearce.

915
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,200
Mrs. Pearce, Eliza's father
has come to take her away.

916
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,500
Give her to him, will you?

917
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,000
Now, wait a minute, governor,
wait a minute.

918
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,200
You and me is men of the world,
ain't we?

919
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,900
Oh, men of the world, are we?

920
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,500
- Yes, you better go, Mrs. Pearce.
- I think so indeed, sir.

921
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,700
Here, governor.

922
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,600
l've took a sort of a fancy
to you and--

923
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,400
[LAUGHS]

924
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,800
lf you want the girl, well, l ain't so set
on having her back home again,

925
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,300
but what l might be
open to is an arrangement.

926
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,800
All I ask is my rights as a father.

927
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,700
You're the last man alive
to expect me to let her go for nothing.

928
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,100
Oh, l can see you're one
of the straight sort, governor.

929
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,200
So, what's a 5-pound note to you?

930
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,100
And what's Eliza to me?

931
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,800
l think you ought to know, Doolittle,

932
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,900
that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

933
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,800
Of course they are, governor.

934
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,500
lf l thought they wasn't, l'd ask 50.

935
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,800
Do you mean to say you'd sell
your daughter for 50 pounds?

936
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,500
Have you no morals, man?

937
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,000
No, no,
l can't afford them, governor.

938
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,300
Neither could you
if you was as poor as me.

939
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,000
Not that l mean any harm,
mind you.

940
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,000
But if Eliza is gonna have
a bit out of this,

941
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,400
why not me too, eh?

942
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,700
Why not?

943
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,300
Well, look at it my way.

944
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,500
What am l? l ask you, what am l?

945
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,100
l'm one of the undeserving poor,
that's what l am.

946
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,200
Now, think
what that means to a man.

947
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,600
lt means he's up against
middle-class morality for all of time.

948
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,100
lf there's anything going
and l puts in for a bit of it,

949
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,400
it's always the same story.

950
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,400
"You're undeserving
so you can't have it."

951
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,600
But my needs is as great
as the most deserving widows

952
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,800
that ever got money out
of six different charities in one week

953
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,100
for the death of the same husband.

954
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,000
l don't need less than
a deserving man, l need more.

955
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,400
l don't eat less hearty than he does.

956
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,400
And l drink, oh, a lot more.

957
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,400
l'm playing straight with you.
l ain't pretending to be deserving.

958
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,700
No, l'm undeserving.

959
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,900
And l mean to go on
being undeserving.

960
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,800
l like it, and that's the truth.

961
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,900
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature

962
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,900
to do him out of the price
of his own daughter,

963
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,600
what he's brought up, fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow

964
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,100
till she's growed big enough

965
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,200
to be interesting
to you two gentlemen?

966
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,900
Well, is 5 pounds unreasonable?
l put it to you.

967
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,300
And l leave it to you.

968
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,000
You know, Pickering, if we took
this man in hand for three months,

969
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,000
he could choose
between a seat in the cabinet

970
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,800
and a popular pulpit in Wales.

971
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,500
We'd better give him a fiver.

972
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,700
He'll make bad use of it, l'm afraid.

973
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,800
Oh, not me, governor.
So help me, l won't.

974
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,400
Just one good spree
for myself and the missus.

975
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,700
Giving pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

976
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,600
And satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been thrown away.

977
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,000
You couldn't spend it better.

978
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,800
Oh, this is irresistible.
Let's give him 1 0.

979
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,700
No, the missus wouldn't have the heart
to spend 1 0, governor.

980
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,500
Ten pounds is a lot of money.

981
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,500
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to happiness.

982
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:21,000
No, you give me what l ask, governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

983
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,100
l rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality, Doolittle.

984
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,200
Why don't you marry
that missus of yours, eh?

985
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,300
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

986
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,300
Who told you that, governor?

987
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,400
Well, nobody told me.
l concluded, naturally.

988
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,400
lf we listen to this man
for another minute,

989
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,900
we shall have no convictions left.

990
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,800
- Five pounds, l think you said.
- Thank you, governor, thank you.

991
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,200
Are you sure you won't have 1 0?

992
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,100
- No, no, perhaps another time.
- I won't, l won't, l won't.

993
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,800
l beg your pardon, miss.

994
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,600
ELlZA: l won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

995
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,600
Blimey, it's Eliza.

996
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,300
Well, l never thought
she'd clean up so good-looking.

997
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,300
She does me credit,
don't she, governor?

998
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,900
Here, what you doing here?

999
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,600
Now, now, you hold your tongue.

1000
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,900
And don't you give these gentlemen
none of your lip.

1001
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,800
lf you have any trouble
with her, governor,

1002
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,400
give her a few licks of the strap.

1003
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,900
That's the way to improve her mind.

1004
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,600
Well, good morning, gentlemen.

1005
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,100
- Cheerio, Eliza.
- Mah!

1006
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,600
There's a man for you.

1007
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,300
A philosophical genius
of the first water.

1008
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,700
Mrs. Pearce,
write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford

1009
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,300
and tell him if he wants a lecturer

1010
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,400
to get in touch
with Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle,

original moralists in England.

1012
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,500
Yes, sir.

1013
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,500
Here, what did he come for?

1014
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,800
Say your vowels.

1015
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,800
l know my vowels.
l knew them before l come.

1016
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,100

There's no use explaining, Pickering.

As a military man, you know that.
Drilling is what she needs.

Now, leave her alone or she'll be

2112
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:25,700
who was giving 5 millions
to fund moral reform societies

2113
02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:28,300
to tell him the most original moralist
in England

2114
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:32,200
was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle,
a common dustman.

2115
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:35,700
Sounds like one of his jokes.

2116
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:39,100
You may call it a joke.
lt's put the lid on me proper.

2117
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:42,300
The old bloke died and left me
4000 pounds a year

2118
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:44,600
in his blooming will.

for money when l wanted it,

02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:53,800

2123
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,100
Now l'm tied neck and heels
and everybody touches me.

2124
02:16:58,300 --> 02:17:01,800
A year ago,
l hadn't a relation in the world

2125

2133
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:26,300

like a ruddy pallbearer?

2134
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:28,300
Your stepmother
wants to marry me.

2135
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:31,400
Now l'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

2136
02:17:31,600 --> 02:17:34,900
Well, if that's the way you feel about it,
why don't you give the money back?

Not my precious professor.

2144

Oh, sent you back, has he?

2145
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:59,800
First he shoves me
in the middle class,

2146
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,800
then he chucks you out
for me to support you.

2147
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,300
That's all part of his plan.

But you double-cross him.

- Well, l'm dashed.
- What am l to do?

2257
02:25:21,300 --> 02:25:23,700
l got tea instead of coffee.
l don't know where anything is.

2258
02:25:23,900 --> 02:25:26,000
- I don't know my appointments.
- Eliza would know.

2259
02:25:26,200 --> 02:25:27,600
Of course she'd know,
but she's gone.

2260
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:29,500
Did either of you
frighten her last night?

2261
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:31,500
We hardly said a word to her.
You were there.

2262
02:25:31,700 --> 02:25:33,200
Did you bully her
after I went to bed?

2263
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:35,400
The other way around.
She threw the slippers at me.

2264
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:37,500
l never gave her
the slightest provocation.

2265
02:25:37,700 --> 02:25:40,100
The slippers came, bang, at my head
before l uttered a word.

2266
02:25:40,300 --> 02:25:42,300
Used the most disgraceful language.
l was shocked.

2267
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:44,100
- Well, l'm dashed.
- I don't understand.

2268
02:25:44,300 --> 02:25:45,800
We've given her every consideration.

2269
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,800
- She admitted it herself.
- Well, l'm dashed.

2270
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,600
Oh, Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something.

2271
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:52,100
- What?
- Well, phone the police.

2272
02:25:52,400 --> 02:25:54,000
What are they
there for in heaven's name?

2273
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:56,300
Mr. Higgins, you can't give
Eliza's name to the police

2274
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:58,500
as if she were a thief
or a lost umbrella.

2275
02:25:58,700 --> 02:26:00,500
But why not? l want to find the girl.

2276
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:03,500
She belongs to me.
l paid 5 pounds for her.

2277
02:26:03,700 --> 02:26:06,500
Quite right. Hello.
Scotland Yard, please.

2278
02:26:06,700 --> 02:26:08,200
Get me some coffee,
would you please?

2279
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:09,600
- Yes, sir.
MAN: Who's there?

2280
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:13,100
Scotland Yard? Yes, of course.
l beg your pardon, yes.

2281
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:16,800
This is Colonel Pickering speaking.
Hugh Pickering.

2282
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:20,300
- 27A Wimpole Street.
<i>- 27A Wimpole Street.</i>

2283
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:23,200
- I want to report a missing person.
<i>- Male or female?</i>

2284
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:26,800
A Miss Eliza Doolittle, yeah.
About 21 .

2285
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:29,100
<i>And her height?</i>

2286
02:26:29,300 --> 02:26:32,300
- I should say about 5'7".
<i>- What color eyes?</i>

2287
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:36,600
Her eyes? Oh, let me think now.
Her eyes, her eyes.

2288
02:26:36,900 --> 02:26:39,400
- Brown.
- Brown, yeah.

2289
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:42,500
No, no, no. Her hair?

2290
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:43,900
Oh, good Lord. Let me...

2291
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:45,900
Well, sort of nondescript
neutral sort of--

2292
02:26:46,100 --> 02:26:47,700
Brown, brown, brown.

2293
02:26:47,900 --> 02:26:50,400
You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yes.

2294
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:52,000
No, no, no, this is her residence.

2295
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:54,200
27A-- Yeah.

2296
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:57,400
About between 3 and 4 this morning,
l understand.

2297
02:26:57,600 --> 02:26:59,200
Yes. No, no, no.

2298
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:01,200
Rela-- No, she's no relation, no.

2299
02:27:01,400 --> 02:27:05,400
What? Well, just let's call her
a good friend, shall we?

2300
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:07,000
l beg your pardon?

2301
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:10,000
Listen to me, my man,
l don't like the tenor of that question.

2302
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:13,400
What the girl does here is our affair.

2303
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:17,600
Your affair is to get her back
so that she can continue doing it.

2304
02:27:17,800 --> 02:27:19,500
Well, l'm dashed.

2305
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:24,600
[SINGlNG] What, in all in heaven,
<i>Can have prompted her to go?</i>

2306
02:27:24,900 --> 02:27:27,700
<i>After such a triumph at the ball?</i>

2307
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:30,400
<i>What could have depressed her?</i>
<i>What could have possessed her?</i>

2308
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:34,200
<i>l cannot understand</i>
<i>The wretch at all</i>

2309
02:27:35,700 --> 02:27:38,500
Higgins, l have an old school chum
at the Home Office.

2310
02:27:38,700 --> 02:27:41,800
Perhaps he can help.
Think l'll give him a ring.

2311
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,600
WOMAN [ON PHONE]:
<i>Number, please.</i>

<i>Whitehall 72-double 4.</i>

2314
02:27:48,700 --> 02:27:51,200
[SINGlNG] Women are irrational
<i>That's all there is to that</i>

2315
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:54,200
<i>Their heads are full of cotton</i>
<i>Hay and rags</i>

2316
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:57,300
<i>They're nothing but exasperating</i>
<i>lrritating, vacillating</i>

2317
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:01,600
<i>Calculating, agitating, maddening</i>
<i>And infuriating hags</i>

MAN:

2319
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:05,600
Oh, l want to speak

2320

<i>- Would you hold on, sir?</i>
- Brew-- Yes, l'll wait.

2321
02:28:13,700 --> 02:28:15,200
Pickering,

2322
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:18,300
why can't a woman
be more like a man?

2323
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:20,000
l beg your pardon?

2324
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:24,100
[SINGlNG] Yes, why can't a woman
<i>Be more like a man?</i>

2325
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:27,300
<i>Men are so honest</i>
<i>So thoroughly square</i>

2326
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:30,700
<i>Eternally noble, historically fair</i>

2327
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:34,000
<i>Who, when you win</i>
<i>Will always give your back a pat</i>

2328
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:37,600
<i>Well, why can't a woman</i>
<i>Be like that?</i>

2329
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,200
<i>Why does everyone</i>
<i>Do what the others do?</i>

2330
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:44,200
<i>Can't a woman learn</i>
<i>To use her head?</i>

2331
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:47,500
<i>Why do they do everything</i>
<i>Their mothers do?</i>

2332
02:28:47,700 --> 02:28:51,000
<i>Why don't they grow up</i>
<i>Well, like their father instead?</i>

2333
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:54,200
<i>Why can't a woman</i>
<i>Take after a man?</i>

2334
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:57,600
<i>Men are so pleasant</i>
<i>So easy to please</i>

2335
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:00,900
<i>Whenever you're with them</i>
<i>You're always at ease</i>

2336
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:03,400
<i>Would you be slighted</i>
<i>lf I didn't speak for hours?</i>

2337
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:04,600
Of course not.

2338
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:06,500
<i>Would you be livid</i>
<i>lf l had a drink or two?</i>

2339
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:07,800
Nonsense.

2340
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
<i>Would you be wounded</i>
<i>lf I never sent you flowers?</i>

2341
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:11,200
Never.

2342
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:13,800
<i>Well, why can't a woman</i>
<i>Be like you?</i>

2343
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:17,400
<i>One man in a million</i>

2344
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:20,900
<i>Now and then</i>
<i>There's one with slight defects</i>

2345
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:24,000
<i>One, perhaps, whose truthfulness</i>
<i>You doubt a bit</i>

2346
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:27,900
<i>But by and large</i>
<i>We are a marvelous sex</i>

2347
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:31,100
<i>Why can't a woman</i>
<i>Take after a man?</i>

2348
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:34,300
<i>Because men are so friendly</i>
<i>Good-natured and kind</i>

2349
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:37,500
<i>A better companion</i>
<i>You never will find</i>

2350

<i>lf l were hours late for dinner</i>
<i>Would you bellow?</i>

2351
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:41,700
Of course not.

2352
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:43,900
<i>lf I forgot your silly birthday</i>
<i>Would you fuss?</i>

2353
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:45,100
Nonsense.

2354
02:29:45,300 --> 02:29:47,300
<i>Would you complain</i>
<i>lf l took out another fellow?</i>

2355
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:48,500
Never.

2356
02:29:48,700 --> 02:29:50,800
<i>Well, why can't a woman</i>
<i>Be like us?</i>

2357
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:55,300
Oh, hello.
Mr. Brewster Budgin there?

2358

<i>- Yes, Budgin here.</i>

Oh, Bruzzie, you'll never

<i>Oh, don't be silly. lt's Pickering.</i>

2361

You're quite right, yes, it is.
Good heavens.

2362
02:30:04,600 --> 02:30:07,100
By George, what a memory.

2363

How are you, Bruzzie?

2364
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,900
Nice to hear your voice.

2365
02:30:11,100 --> 02:30:14,400
What? Oh, don't say that.
ls it already 30 years? Good heavens.

2366
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:16,500
You're quite right.
Yes, oceans of water.

2367
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:18,500
Listen, Bruzzie,
l'll tell you why l rang up.

2368
02:30:18,700 --> 02:30:22,000
Something rather unpleasant's
happened. Could l come and see you?

Well, l could.
Yes, now, straight away.

<i>Why can't a woman be like me?</i>

2401
02:32:12,900 --> 02:32:14,500
Do you mean to say
that after you'd done

2402
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:17,300
this wonderful thing for them
without making a single mistake,

2403
02:32:17,500 --> 02:32:19,400
they just sat there,
never said a word to you?

2404
02:32:19,600 --> 02:32:23,200
Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?

2405
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:26,500
Not a word. They just sat there
congratulating each other

2406
02:32:26,700 --> 02:32:27,900
on how marvelous they'd been.

2407
02:32:28,100 --> 02:32:31,700
How glad they were it was all over
and what a bore it had all been.

2408
02:32:31,900 --> 02:32:33,100
This is simply appalling.

2409
02:32:33,400 --> 02:32:35,100
l should not have thrown
my slippers at him,

2410
02:32:35,300 --> 02:32:37,200
l should've thrown the fire irons.

2411
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:38,700
HlGGlNS: Oh, is mother in?
- What's that?

2412
02:32:38,900 --> 02:32:40,200
Henry.

2413
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:43,000
l knew it wouldn't be too long.

2414
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:45,200
Now, remember,

2415
02:32:45,400 --> 02:32:47,500
you not only danced
with a prince last night,

2416
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:50,500
you behaved like a princess.

2417
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:59,600
Mother, the most confounded thing.
Do you...?

2418
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:04,000
You?

2419
02:33:04,600 --> 02:33:07,500
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

2420
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:10,300
- Am l--?
- Of course you are.

2421
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:13,900
You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

2422
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:17,000
Don't you dare try that game on me.
l taught it to you.

2423
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:19,200
Now, get up and come home
and stop being a fool.

2424
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:20,700
You've caused me enough trouble.

2425
02:33:20,900 --> 02:33:22,500
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.

2426
02:33:22,700 --> 02:33:24,500
No woman could resist
such an invitation.

2427
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:26,600
How did this baggage get here
in the first place?

2428
02:33:26,800 --> 02:33:29,500
Eliza came to see me this morning
and l was delighted to have her.

2429
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:32,200
And if you don't promise to behave,
l must ask you to leave.

2430
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:34,300
You mean to say l'm to put on
my Sunday manners

2431
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:37,200
for this thing that l created
out of the squashed cabbage leaves

2432
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:38,400
of Covent Garden?

2433
02:33:38,600 --> 02:33:39,800
That's precisely what l mean.

2434
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,600
Well, l'll see her damned first.

2435
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:44,800
However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

2436
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:46,800
lt was very difficult.

2437
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,400
l should never have known
how ladies and gentlemen behave

2438
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:52,300
if it hadn't been
for Colonel Pickering.

2439
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:55,700
He always showed me
that he felt and thought about me

2440
02:33:55,900 --> 02:33:59,300
as if l were something better
than a common flower girl.

2441
02:34:01,900 --> 02:34:05,700
You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up,

2442
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:07,800
the difference between a lady
and a flower girl

2443
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,800
is not how she behaves,
but how she is treated.

2444
02:34:14,300 --> 02:34:16,300
l shall always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins

2445
02:34:16,500 --> 02:34:19,500
because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

2446
02:34:20,900 --> 02:34:23,600
But l know l shall always be a lady
to Colonel Pickering

2447
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:27,100
because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

2448
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:31,100
[GROWLS]

2449
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:32,900
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

2450
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:35,700
The bishop is here, madam.
Shall l show him into the garden?

2451
02:34:35,900 --> 02:34:38,300
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no.

2452
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:43,100
l should be excommunicated.
l'll see him in the library.

2453
02:34:43,300 --> 02:34:45,900
Eliza, if my son
starts breaking up things,

2454
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:48,700
l give you full permission
to have him evicted.

2455
02:34:48,900 --> 02:34:51,800
Henry, dear, l suggest you stick
to two subjects:

2456
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,300
The weather and your health.

2457
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,200
Well, you've had a bit
of your own back, as you call it.

2458
02:35:23,400 --> 02:35:25,600
Have you had enough
and are you going to be reasonable

2459
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:26,800
or do you want any more?

2460
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,800
You want me back
only to pick up your slippers

2461
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,600
and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

2462
02:35:31,800 --> 02:35:34,000
- I didn't say l wanted you back at all.
- Oh, indeed?

2463
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:36,900
- Then what are we talking about?
- Well, about you, not about me.

2464
02:35:37,100 --> 02:35:39,800
lf you come back, you'll be treated
as you've always been treated.

2465
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,400
l can't change my nature.
l don't intend to change my manners.

2466
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:44,800
My manners are exactly the same
as Colonel Pickering's.

2467
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:46,100
That's not true.

2468
02:35:46,300 --> 02:35:48,700
He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

2469
02:35:48,900 --> 02:35:51,000
Well, l treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

2470
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:52,500
Oh, l see. The same to everybody.

2471
02:35:52,700 --> 02:35:53,800
Just so.

2472
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,700
You see, the great secret, Eliza,
is not a question of good manners

2473
02:35:56,900 --> 02:36:00,400
or bad manners
or any particular sort of manners,

2474
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:05,700
but having the same manner
for all human souls.

2475
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:08,100
The question is not
whether l treat you rudely,

2476
02:36:08,300 --> 02:36:11,700
whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

2477
02:36:11,900 --> 02:36:13,900
l don't care how you treat me.

2478
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:15,500
l don't mind your swearing at me.

2479
02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:18,000
l shouldn't mind a black eye.
l've had one before this.

2480
02:36:18,300 --> 02:36:20,100
But l won't be passed over.

2481
02:36:20,300 --> 02:36:22,500
Well, then get out of my way,
for l won't stop for you.

2482
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:24,500
You talk about me
as though l was a motor bus.

2483
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:25,800
So you are a motor bus.

2484
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,800
All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

2485
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:31,800
But l can get along without you.
Don't you think l can't.

2486
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,800
l know you can. I told you you could.

2487
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:42,600
You've never wondered, l suppose
whether l could get along without you.

2488
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:46,100
Don't you try to get around me.

2489
02:36:46,300 --> 02:36:47,400
You'll have to.

2490
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:51,500
So l can, without you
or any soul on earth.

2491
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:55,700
l shall miss you, Eliza.

2492
02:36:55,900 --> 02:36:58,600
l've learned something
from your idiotic notions.

2493
02:36:58,800 --> 02:37:01,900
l confess that, humbly and gratefully.

2494
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:06,700
Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

2495
02:37:06,900 --> 02:37:09,200
When you feel lonely without me,
you can turn it on.

2496
02:37:09,400 --> 02:37:11,000
lt has no feelings to hurt.

2497
02:37:12,900 --> 02:37:16,200
Well, l can't turn your soul on.

2498
02:37:18,400 --> 02:37:21,200
Ooh. You are a devil.

2499
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:23,900
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily

2500
02:37:24,100 --> 02:37:26,400
as someone can twist her arms
to hurt her.

2501
02:37:26,700 --> 02:37:28,400
What am l to come back for?

2502
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:30,800
For the fun of it.
That's why l took you on.

2503
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:34,000
And you may throw me out tomorrow
if l don't do everything you want me to.

2504
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:37,200
Yes, and you may walk out tomorrow
if l don't do everything you want me to.

2505
02:37:37,400 --> 02:37:38,500
And live with my father?

2506
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:41,000
Yes, or sell flowers.
Or would you rather marry Pickering?

2507
02:37:41,200 --> 02:37:42,600
l wouldn't marry you
if you asked me,

2508
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:44,500
and you're nearer my age
than what he is.

2509
02:37:44,700 --> 02:37:46,400
- Than he is.
- I'll talk as l like.

2510
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:48,100
You're not my teacher now.

2511
02:37:48,300 --> 02:37:51,100
That's not what l want,
and you don't think it is.

2512
02:37:51,300 --> 02:37:53,300
l've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

2513
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:55,600
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day.

2514
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:57,300
Sheets and sheets.

2515
02:37:57,500 --> 02:38:00,000
ln short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is.

2516
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:02,100
- Is that it?
- No, l don't.

2517
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:05,700
That's not the sort of feeling
l want from you.

2518
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:08,100
l want a little kindness.

2519
02:38:08,300 --> 02:38:11,400
l know l'm a common ignorant girl
and you're a book-learned gentleman.

2520
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:14,200
But l'm not dirt under your feet.

2521
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:15,800
What l done--

2522
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:19,500
What l did
was not for the taxis and the dresses,

2523
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:23,000
but because we were
pleasant together and I've come to--

2524
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:26,600
Came to care for you.

2525
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:28,200
Not to want you to make love to me

2526
02:38:28,400 --> 02:38:30,200
and not forgetting
the difference between us,

2527
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:34,000
but more friendly-like.

2528
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:38,300
Well, of course. That's how l feel.

2529
02:38:38,500 --> 02:38:41,200
And how Pickering feels.

2530
02:38:41,400 --> 02:38:43,600
- Eliza, you're a fool.
- That's not the proper answer.

2531
02:38:43,800 --> 02:38:45,700
lt's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

2532
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:47,900
lf you're a lady,
give up feeling neglected

2533
02:38:48,100 --> 02:38:50,000
if the men you know
don't spend half their time

2534
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:52,700
sniveling over you and the other half
giving you black eyes.

2535
02:38:52,900 --> 02:38:55,300
You find me cold, unfeeling,
selfish, don't you?

2536
02:38:55,500 --> 02:38:57,400
Be off with you
to the sort of people you like.

2537
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:59,400
Marry some sentimental hog
with lots of money

2538
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:02,600
and a thick pair of lips to kiss you
and a thick pair of boots to kick you.

2539
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:05,900
lf you can't appreciate what you've got,
get what you can appreciate.

2540
02:39:06,100 --> 02:39:07,200
Oh, l can't talk to you.

2541
02:39:07,400 --> 02:39:10,700
You always turn everything
against me. l'm always in the wrong.

2542
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:13,000
But don't be too sure
that you have me under your feet

2543
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:14,900
to be trampled on and talked down.

2544
02:39:15,100 --> 02:39:17,900
l'll marry, Freddy, l will,
soon as l'm able to support him.

2545
02:39:18,900 --> 02:39:20,400
Freddy?

2546
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:22,800
That poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy

2547
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:24,700

Woman, don't you understand?
l've made you a consort for a king.

That makes him king enough for me.

He wasn't brought up to it as l was.

That toadying ignoramus?

Teach him my methods,
my discoveries?

2558

You take one step in that direction

Wring away. What do l care?
l knew you'd strike me one day.

That's done you, Henry Higgins,
